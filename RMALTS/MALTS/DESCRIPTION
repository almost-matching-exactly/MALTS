Description: Implementation of the Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS) 
    algorithm for observational causal inference (Parikh, Rudin, Volfovsky: JMLR 
    2022). MALTS learns a distance metric between units that prioritizes
    variables more predictive of the outcome, matches accordingly, and uses the 
    resulting matches to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects. For 
    more information and examples, see the Almost-Matching-Exactly website.
